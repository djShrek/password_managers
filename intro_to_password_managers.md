What is a Password Manager?
----------------------------

- An application that helpers a user store and organize passwords
- Modern password managers have more features than this such as form filling and password generation
- Generally store the passwords encrypted, requiring the user to create a master password, ideally a strong password that grants access to the entire password database.

## Why should you use a password manager?

- Even the most complicated passwords are useless if users have a heard time managing and remembering them
- But if you choose simple passwords, they are easily more guessable and susceptible to being “cracked”
- Using the same password for different sites is not a good idea because once it is compromised then all your sites are in danger of being accessed.
- Therefore, you should use an application to manage your passwords for you

## Vulnerabilities

- Some password managers use a user-selected master password or passphrase to form the “key” used to encrypt the protected passwords. The security of this approach depends on the strength of the chosen password (which might be guessed or brute-forced).
- A compromised master password renders all of the protected passwords vulnerable.

### Lastpass notes:

- Lastpass is free with premium version that lets you sync with all devices
- Lastpass has been hacked before but not that badly (users with long passwords very unlikely affected)
- One-time key recovery to recover master password if you forget it

### 1password notes:

- 1password is (currently) $25
- Does not use servers to sync (uses local database). Bad if you forget PW because that’s it
- Hacking 1password is a lot harder because the local db is stored on mac or pc.
- Can sync to other devices via dropbox or wifi
- Can safely store other sensitive info such as ss#s, passport info etc. (Lastpass feature as well but...)
- Has better technical support
- Has TouchID support

## Closing points

- If you don’t use a password manager, start using one
- If you don’t want to spend money, use LastPass. Freemium provides a lot of features and will save you from the headaches from trying to remember all your passwords
- Use a strong password for your Lastpass app
